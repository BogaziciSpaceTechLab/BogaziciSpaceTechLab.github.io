This repository hosts our [LAB Website](https://BogaziciSpaceTechLab.github.io/).

Yiğit Günsür Elmacıoğlu created this website using Jekyll and github repo of [AcademicPages](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) for the main template. There are no single template for the entire website but many alternative website layouts have been used for different pages. Most of them can be found on [Jekyll Themes](http://jekyllthemes.org).

A Github Pages template for academic websites. This was forked (then detached) by [Stuart Geiger](https://github.com/staeiou) from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/), which is © 2016 Michael Rose and released under the MIT License. See LICENSE.md.
