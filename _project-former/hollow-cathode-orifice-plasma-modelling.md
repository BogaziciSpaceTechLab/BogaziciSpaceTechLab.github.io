This research project involves developing numerical models to simulate the plasma in the insert and the orifice regions of a hollow cathode. The initial work will be on the 0-D global mass and energy balance. Later on a 2-D model will be developed. The codes are being written in MATLAB. This project is being supported by TUBITAK, under the project number TUBITAK-112M862.

Oguz Korkmaz is working on this research project.
