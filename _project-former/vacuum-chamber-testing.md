The goal of this effort is to build a vacuum chamber that will be capable of providing the desired vacuum environment for plasma thruster testing. The plan is to purchase all the necessary components and then putting them together to have a functioning test facility. The chamber has already been bought and placed inside the laboratory space. The pumps, compressors, chillers and other relevant components are either bought, ordered or about to be ordered. If built, this chamber will be the first vacuum chamber in Turkey that will be capable of supporting space propulsion research. This research is being subborted by Bogazici University Office of Scientific Research Funds with project number BAP-6184.

Assoc. Prof. Huseyin Yilmaz is a consultant and a major contributor to any work done related to the construction of the chamber. He is also an official adviser to the TUBITAK- 112M862 and TUBITAK-113M244 projects. His advise/contribution has been crucial. Without his support such a facility and other experimental research work would not have progressed as much as they did. His expertise in the fields of vacuum systems, in materials, in manufacturing has been invaluable.
