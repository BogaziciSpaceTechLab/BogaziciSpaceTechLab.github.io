This research involves the study of microwave heating of propellant gas that will later on be expanded to produce thrust. The work involves the study of wave plasma interactions. The aim is to build a prototype thruster and conduct various parametric tests. The research also involves conducting certain modeling using COMSOL multi-physics program. This research is being subborted by Bogazici University Office of Scientific Research Funds under the project number BAP-8960.

Mehmet Serhan Yıldız is conducting this research work.
